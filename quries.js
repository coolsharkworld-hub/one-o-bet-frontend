This ensures that we meet regulatory standards while effectively</p><p><strong>5.4.2 Risk MitigationStrategies</strong></p><p>Risk mitigation involves putting in place measures to control and minimize the potential risks of money laundering and terrorist financing identified in our risk assessment. These measures are designed to ensure that we operate within our acceptable risk tolerance level. When our risk assessment indicates a high risk of money laundering or terrorist financing, we will develop and apply risk mitigation strategies.</p><p><strong>Key Components of Risk</strong><br>Mitigation: In all situations, risk mitigation involves implementing controls and measures, including:</p><ul><li>Focusing on vulnerable operational aspects like products, services, customers, business relationships, and geographic locations that could be exploited by money launderers and criminals.</li><li>Keeping senior management informed about compliance initiatives, identified deficiencies, and corrective actions, and filed suspicious transaction reports.</li><li>Ensuring program continuity despite changes in management, employees, or company structure.</li><li>Adhering to regulatory record-keeping and reporting requirements, recommendations for anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing compliance, and promptly updating in response to changes.</li><li>Identifying reportable transactions and ensuring accurate filing of necessary reports.</li><li>Incorporating anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing compliance into job roles and performance evaluations of relevant personnel.</li><li>Providing adequate supervision and training for employees handling currency transactions, completing reports, monitoring suspicious transactions, and other program-related activities.</li></ul><p>Tailored Risk Mitigation: For higher-risk situations, additional risk mitigation strategies are applied, including:</p><ul><li>Increasing awareness of high-risk scenarios across all business lines.</li><li>Enhancing the frequency of ongoing transaction monitoring and business relationship checks.</li><li>Escalating approval for account or relationship establishment, even if not typically required.</li><li>Strengthening ongoing control levels and relationship reviews.</li><li>Requesting documented information from high-risk customers about the measures they've taken to prevent misuse by money launderers and terrorists.</li><li>Verifying customer identity through reliable, independent sources.</li><li>Ensuring no transaction occurs with potential customers until proper identification and account opening details are obtained.</li><li>Establishing a process to approve high-risk relationships as part of the customer acceptance process, or declining business with those exceeding our risk tolerance.</li><li>Establishing a process to exit high-risk relationships that surpass our risk tolerance.</li></ul><p><strong>Understanding Risks: </strong>1oBet is committed to conducting a thorough risk assessment to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities related to money laundering and terrorist financing. This assessment helps us understand the risks the business might face and take appropriate measures to address them.</p><p><strong>Key Considerations: </strong>The risk assessment process will document and take into account several factors, including:</p><ul><li>Products, services, and how they are delivered.</li><li>Geographic locations and areas where operations occur.</li><li>Characteristics of our customers.</li></ul><p><strong>Adapting Over Time: </strong>The risk assessment isn't a fixed document; it evolves as circumstances change. It may identify high-risk situations that require specific risk mitigation controls and monitoring. For instance, when a customer is categorized as high-risk, we intensify ongoing monitoring, update customer identification information more frequently, and implement other suitable enhanced measures.</p><p><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> At the start of a new customer relationship and on an ongoing basis for existing customers, we conduct initial and periodic risk assessments to ensure our risk understanding remains up-to-date</p><p><strong>15.5 Client and Business Risk</strong></p><p><strong>15.5.1 Products, Services, and Delivery Channels</strong></p><p><strong>Identifying Elevated Risk: </strong>1oBet identifies certain products, services, or combinations thereof that could present a heightened risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. This includes products and services facilitating the movement and conversion of assets through the financial system, which inherently carry higher risks.</p><p><strong>Specific High-Risk Areas: </strong>Certain financial services have been recognized by financial regulators, governmental bodies, and reputable sources as having the potential for high-risk money laundering or terrorist financing. These include:</p><ul><li>Wire transactions</li><li>Transactions involving third parties</li><li>Business relationships conducted without face-to-face interactions</li></ul><p>Understanding these higher-risk areas allows us to implement targeted risk mitigation strategies and monitoring to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations.</p><p><strong>15.5.2 Geographic Locations and Areas of Operation</strong></p><p><strong>Understanding Geographic Risks:</strong> Certain geographic locations are more prone to money laundering and terrorist financing risks. These areas have been highlighted by reputable sources like the FATF(Financial Action Task Force) and Transparency International.</p><p>High-Risk Countries: Clients<br>originating from or associated with these countries are deemed high risk:</p><ul><li>Countries are known for sanctions, embargoes, or similar measures.</li><li>Countries identified by credible sources as supporting terrorist activities or hosting designated terrorist organizations.</li><li>Countries known as tax havens or hubs for significant criminal activities.</li><li>Countries flagged by FATF as uncooperative in anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing efforts.</li><li>Countries lacking proper money laundering or terrorist financing laws and regulations, or with substantial corruption levels.</li></ul><p>Exclusion of High-Risk Countries: 1oBet<br>refrains from conducting business or offering services to individuals in<br>countries listed under comprehensive international sanctions.</p><p><strong>15.5.3 Customer Relationships</strong></p><p><strong>Comprehensive Understanding:</strong> Our risk assessment calls for a thorough understanding of<br>customers through KYC (Know Your Customer) practices. This entails more than<br>just identification or record keeping; it involves comprehending their<br>activities, transaction patterns, and operational methods.</p><p>Factors Considered: Factors taken into account include:</p><ul><li>Duration of the customer relationship.</li><li>Customers seeking significant transactions.</li><li>Customers with regulatory or enforcement issues.</li><li>Customers with numerous online complaints.</li><li>Customers with challenging identification verification.</li><li>Politically exposed customers.</li></ul><p><strong>Categorizing Customer<br>Risk: </strong>Every customer is assigned a low, medium, or high-risk rating for money laundering and/or terrorist financing. This rating may evolve over time based on re-assessments. The extent of customer due diligence varies according to the initial risk rating and subsequent changes. High-risk players undergo enhanced due diligence right from the start.</p><p><strong>15.5.4 Regulatory Risk</strong></p><p><strong>Ensuring Legal Compliance:</strong><br>Regulatory risk pertains to failing to meet our obligations under relevant<br>legislation. Examples of regulatory breaches encompass:</p><ul><li>Incorrect customer identification.</li><li>Insufficient staff training.</li><li>Lack of an anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) program.</li><li>Failure to report suspicious transactions.</li><li>Absence of an MLRO (Money Laundering Reporting Officer).</li><li>Incomplete customer record keeping.</li></ul><p><strong>15.5 Compliance Training</strong></p><p><strong>Building Knowledge:</strong> 1oBet maintains a comprehensive training program for relevant employees and individuals representing the company. The objective is to ensure that those who interact with customers, oversee customer transaction activity, or handle funds comprehend reporting, customer identification, and record-keeping requirements.</p><p><strong>New Employee Training: </strong>New employees must complete anti-money laundering and terrorist financing compliance training within their initial three months. For customer-facing personnel, training occurs before engaging with customers.</p><p><strong>Training Approach:</strong> Our custom-designed training program is delivered electronically through a learning management system.

The training program is continuously reviewed and updated to accommodate changing requirements</p><p><strong>15.6. Minimum Standards - Know Your Customer (KYC) Policy</strong></p><p><strong>Establishing KYC Standards: </strong>1oBet adheres to stringent standards for Know-Your-Customer (KYC) practices. These standards mandate thorough due diligence on each potential customer before establishing a business relationship. This involves verifying their identity, as well as that of their representatives and beneficial owners, based on reliable and independent sources in compliance with domestic and European AML/CFT regulations.</p><p><strong>KYC Interpretation: </strong>The KYC principle commences with customer identification using essential identification documents. This initial identification, complemented by other collected information, serves as the basis for applying the Customer Acceptance Policy. Beyond objective criteria, subjective factors that might raise suspicions about a customer require careful attention.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Data and Ongoing Monitoring:</strong> : KYC involves not just static data but also dynamic information acquired during the customer relationship. As such, it necessitates continuous follow-up and monitoring.</p><p><strong>15.6.1. Customer Identification and Verification (KYC)</strong></p><p><strong>Essential Customer Identification:</strong> during the initiation of<br>commercial relationships are pivotal for both anti-money laundering regulations<br>and the KYC policy.</p><p><strong>Key Principles:</strong></p><ul><li>Each customer (individual or legal entity) must be identified using original supporting documents.</li><li>These documents are centrally recorded.</li><li>Identification requires "face-to-face" interaction.</li><li>Remote identification is permissible through a dedicated acceptance process, albeit with limitations on transactions and product access.</li><li>Registered by IT means, identified individuals must undergo a complete identification process.</li><li>Incomplete identification results in customer non-acceptance.</li></ul><p><strong>Politically Exposed Persons (PEP)</strong>: A distinctive identification process is applied to customers classified as PEPs, regardless of their residence.</p><p><strong>15.6.2. Risk Profile Calculation</strong></p><p>To determine the required level of AML/CFT due diligence for a customer, a "Compliance" risk profile is initially calculated upon entering the relationship (Low, Medium, High), then recalculated daily.</p><p><strong>15.6.3. Customer Acceptance Policy</strong></p><p><strong>Customer Identification</strong>:</p><p>The Client Identification process confirms the existence and identity of the individual engaged in a business relationship with 1oBet, obtaining pertinent identity information.</p><p>This includes: Validating the individual's existence via identification documents.</p><ul><li>Validating the individual's existence via identification documents.</li><li>Conducting due diligence on the customer's identity, including cross-referencing names against government watch lists.</li><li>Identifying politically exposed persons.</li><li>Assessing third-party involvement.</li><li>Reviewing publicly available information on the customer (e.g., adverse media, social media).</li><li>Evaluating their background and reputation.</li><li>Comprehensive record-keeping of acquired data and documents.</li></ul><p><strong>15.6.3.2. Customer Identification Details</strong></p><p><strong>Standard Identification Requirements: </strong>This section outlines the standard identification criteria for individuals engaged in a business relationship with 1oBet. These guidelines are generally sufficient for most scenarios. However, if a customer is deemed to pose a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing, in accordance with our risk matrix, additional identity information is necessary, along with heightened verification measures.</p><p><strong>Heightened Verification:</strong> If the standard verification process raises doubts about identity, the number of matches required to establish confidence in the individual's identity will increase. Any concerns encountered must be reported to the MLRO.</p><p><strong>Primary Identification Absence:</strong> Customers unable to provide primary ID must provide<br>reasons for this, but they might not be eligible to maintain an account.</p><p><strong>Documentary Evidence Validity: </strong>All submitted documentary evidence should be recent and<br>adhere to specific validity guidelines:</p><ul><li>Passports and driver's licenses must be valid and not expired.</li><li>Utility bills should be dated within the last 3 months.</li></ul><p><strong>Beneficial Ownership and Additional Information:</strong> Customers will be asked if they're acting on behalf of someone else. If so, additional details will be required.</p><p><strong>Acceptable Proof of Identity - Photo:</strong></p><ul><li>Valid passport</li><li>Valid photo card driving license (full or provisional)</li><li>National identity card (for non-UK nationals issued by EEA member states and Switzerland)</li><li>Identity card from the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland</li><li><strong>Acceptable Proof of<br>Identity - Non-Photo: Documents issued by government departments, showing the<br>person's name, residential address, or date of birth:</strong></li><li>Court appointment instrument (e.g., grant of probate, bankruptcy)</li><li>Current council tax demand letter or statement</li><li>Recent bank statements or credit/debit card statements from regulated financial sector firms in the UK, EU, or equivalent jurisdiction</li><li>Recent utility bill (gas, water, electricity, telephone)</li><li>Valid photo card driving license (full or provisional)</li><li>Solicitor's letter confirming house purchase or previous address change</li></ul><p><strong>Verification Checks:</strong> When accepting identity evidence from a customer, thorough checks must be conducted on the provided evidence to confirm their identity. These checks and record-keeping will be overseen by the MLRO or under their supervision.</p><p>.</p><p><strong>Photo ID Checks:</strong><br>Standard checks on photo IDs include:</p><ul><li>Comparing the customer's likeness with the photo</li><li>Verifying that the date of birth matches the apparent age</li><li>Validating the ID's authenticity and expiration</li><li>Ensuring name consistency with other provided documents</li></ul><p><strong>Secondary ID Checks: For secondary evidence of ID:</strong></p><ul><li>Confirming address alignment with photo ID</li><li>Ensuring name alignment with photo ID</li></ul><p><strong>Notification and Manual Checks: </strong>Every customer is assigned a low, medium, or high-risk rating for money laundering and/or terrorist financing. This rating may evolve over time based on re-assessments. The extent of customer due diligence varies according to the initial risk rating and subsequent changes. High-risk players undergo enhanced due diligence right from the start.</p><p><strong>Additional Identity Verification Triggers:</strong></p><p>Identity verification processes may also be triggered by:</p><p>• Withdrawal requests to different accounts than used for deposits</p><p>• Multiple deposits in a short period (five or more within an hour)</p><p>• Suspicious deposit patterns with multiple payment cards (three or more methods in a week)</p><p>• Mismatch between registration country and IP address</p><p><strong>Document Retention:</strong> Copies of all identification<br>documents will be retained.</p><p><strong>15.6.3.4. Request for Additional Documents</strong></p><p>Additional documents may be requested to validate activities or understand patterns: • Proof of Bank Account - A bank statement with the customer's name, IBAN, and bank name (for withdrawals to bank accounts) • Proof of Payment<br>Card - Front side of card or bank statement with card details and customer's name for suspicious deposit patterns) • Bank Statements and Payslips - For customers displaying problematic gambling patterns</p><p><strong>15.6.3.5. Managing Impersonation Risk</strong></p><p><strong>Risk-Based Identity Checks:</strong> Additional customer<br>identity checks are allowed based on risk assessment: • Initial payment via an account in the customer's name with an EU/EEA regulated credit institution or equivalent jurisdiction • Verifying other aspects of the customer's identity or digital presence • Telephone contact with the customer using verified home/business number before account opening or further transactions, verifying provided identity information</p><p><strong>15.6.3.6. Keeping Information Updated</strong></p><p><strong>Confirmation of Identity:</strong> Once a customer's identity is confirmed, there's no need for repeated confirmation. However, if any doubt arises about the held information, the identification process will be repeated, including customer identification</p><p><strong>Information Review and Updates:</strong> 1oBet may periodically review and update customer documentation as needed. Changes like name changes would require new documents.</p><p><strong>15.6.4. Continuous Transaction Monitoring</strong></p><p><strong>Manual Processing and Review:</strong><br>Cash-out requests are manually processed and reviewed daily by the Payments Team. Security checks ensure compliance with Gaming Control Board Curacao Policy and Company terms.</p><p><strong>15.7. Internal Control Organization</strong></p><p><strong>Reporting Suspicious Activities:</strong> Any member can report suspicious activities to the MLRO (Nominated Officer) if they suspect money laundering or terrorist financing. Suspicion arises when there are reasonable grounds to believe someone is engaged in such activities.</p><p><strong>15.7.1. Reporting Suspicious Transactions</strong></p><p><strong>Knowledge and Suspicion:</strong> Knowledge involves knowing something as true, often inferred from circumstances. Suspicion is subjective and falls short of concrete evidence, implying a foundation. Unusual transactions aren't necessarily suspicious.</p><p><strong>Consideration and Assessment:</strong> Unusual behavior doesn't automatically imply money laundering suspicion. The MLRO assesses circumstances, possibly questioning customers or others. The choice depends on existing knowledge about the customer and transaction.</p><p><strong>Objective Test of Suspicion:</strong><br>"Reasonable grounds to know or suspect" introduces an objective test of suspicion. It's met when facts or circumstances lead a reasonable person to infer knowledge or suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing.</p><p><strong>Reasonable Steps: </strong>Failing the suspicion test is mitigated if staff can show they took reasonable steps to understand the customer and transaction rationale.</p><p><strong>15.7.2 Reporting Suspicious Activity</strong></p><p><strong>Process of Reporting:</strong> If any staff member suspects a transaction involves money laundering or becomes aware of such activity, they must report it to the MLRO using the 1oBet Suspicious Transaction Report form.</p><p><strong>Reporting Form Completion:</strong> The completed form<br>should be printed, signed, and dated by the reporting staff member before<br>handing it to the MLRO. The MLRO records the receipt date and time.</p><p><strong>MLRO's Decision and Action:</strong> Upon receiving the form, the MLRO decides on necessary actions, such as reporting to the Gaming Control Board, Curacao, or conducting further inquiries. The decision and its reasons are recorded in customer files, and the reporting staff member is informed.</p><p><strong>Reporting to GCB: </strong>If the matter is referred to GCB, the MLRO or a subordinate completes the FIAU report form. The GCB report form is signed off by the MLRO or CEO. Transactions are halted until GCB consent is received, with a 7-working-day review period.</p><p><strong>Consent Outcome:</strong> If no response is received within this time, transactions may proceed without informing the customer. GCB can grant earlier consent or refuse, with a further 31-day consideration period. After this, they either proceed with proceedings or allow the transaction to continue.<br>transaction to continue.</p><p><strong>Record Keeping:</strong> The MLRO submits a digital report to GCB and maintains paper files. No customer record or computer system should reference suspicious activity reporting to prevent tipping off. Informing a customer about a SAR or investigation is a criminal offense.</p><p><strong>SAR Records Storage:</strong> Records of Suspicious Activity Reports are stored in a central reporting file managed by the MLRO.</p><p><strong>15.7.3 Identifying Suspicious Activity</strong></p><p>Recognizing Suspicion: Transactions may raise suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing, regardless of the transaction amount. There is no set monetary limit for reporting suspicious activity (SAR). Suspicious transactions might involve seemingly insignificant factors that collectively indicate potential involvement in money laundering or terrorist financing.</p><p><strong>Indicators of Suspicion: </strong>1oBet will investigate complex, unusually large transactions, and unusual transaction patterns lacking clear economic or lawful purpose. The context of the transaction matters, varying between customers. Evaluation is based on industry norms, business knowledge, and customer behavior.</p><p><strong>Assessing Suspicion:</strong><br>Suspicion is tied to behavior, not individuals. Factors like a transaction's alignment with business norms and customer history determine suspicion. Below are some indicators aiding assessment.</p><p><strong>15.7.4 Suspicious Transaction Indicators</strong></p><p><strong>Risk-Linked Factors:</strong> Some products, services, activities, or channels pose higher money laundering risks. Indicators or "red flags" signaling potential risk include:</p><ul><li>Unusual frequency of transactions.</li><li>Large cash deposits or withdrawals.</li><li>Rapid movement of funds.</li></ul><p><strong>Collective Analysis:</strong> One indicator alone might not raise suspicion, but several combined can warrant closer examination before reporting.</p><p><strong>Terrorism Connection: </strong>If a transaction is halted due to suspicion of terrorism involvement, a terrorist property report is required. Suspicious transactions linked to attempted terrorism or money laundering must be reported.</p><p><strong>Retrospective Awareness: </strong>Identifying certain indicators might retrospectively raise suspicion about past transactions that seemed innocent initially.</p><p><strong>15.7.4.1 Application and<br>Identification</strong></p><p><strong>Application Discrepancies:</strong> •<br>Inconsistent information compared to application.</p><p>• Address or customer details<br>differing from initial registration.</p><p>• Inability to provide government-issued ID.</p><p>• Change of address to high-fraud areas after application.</p><p>• Unverifiable individual details.</p><p>• Use of mail drops or high-risk addresses instead of physical ones.</p><p>• Inconsistency in transaction volume, deposits, and withdrawals.</p><p><strong>15.7.4.2 Account Settlement</strong></p><p><strong>Large Cross-Border Transfers:</strong> •<br>Significant wire transfer payments across borders.</p><p>• Settlements from unrelated third parties.</p><p>• Excessive or ongoing large credit refunds.</p><p><strong>15.7.4.3 Transaction and<br>Customer Monitoring</strong></p><p><strong>Unusual Betting Behavior:</strong></p><p>•Unusually high stakes beyond known means.</p><p>• High spending despite low income and accommodations.</p><p>• Unconventional gambling patterns indicate unlawful income.</p><p><strong>Atypical Gambling Patterns:</strong></p><p>High deposits with minimal gameplay.</p><p>• Regular high spending, accepting losses as part of money laundering.</p><p>• Gradual spending increases over time to conceal high expenditure.</p><p>• Frequent small bets leading to abnormal annual spending.</p><p>• Low-risk, high-spend gambling (e.g., red and black in roulette).</p><p><strong>Commercial Risk Alert:</strong>  High spending leads to significant commercial risk for the operator.</p><p><strong>Terrorist Financing Indicators:</strong><br>Indicators for terrorism-related financing often resemble money laundering indicators, albeit with some differences. For instance, amounts for terrorist financing tend to be smaller.</p><p><strong>15.7.4.1 Application and Identification</strong></p><p><strong>Discrepancies in Application:</strong></p><p>•Conflicting information compared to the application.</p><p>• Divergence in application details, address, or customer from initial registration.</p><p>•Inability to furnish government-issued identification.</p><p>• Address change to high-fraud regions or problematic jurisdictions soon after application.</p><p>• Lack of reliable third-party or governmental verification for individuals.</p><p>• Address linked to mail drops or high-risk locations instead of physical addresses.</p><p>•Inconsistencies in transaction volume, deposits, and withdrawals.</p><p><strong>15.7.4.2 Account Settlement</strong></p><p><strong>Large Cross-Border Transfers:</strong> •<br>Significant wire transfers involving different countries. • Settlements or<br>partial settlements from unrelated third parties. • Excessive or continuous<br>significant credit refunds.</p><p><strong>15.7.4.3 Transaction and Customer Monitoring</strong></p><p><strong>Unusual Betting Behavior:</strong> • Unusually high stakes surpassing known means.</p><p>• Excessive spending by a customer with limited income or modest accommodations.</p><p>• No fixed amount triggering a Suspicious ActivityReport (SAR); depends on the customer's profile and circumstances.</p><p>• Patterns of gambling deviating from the customer's typical behavior, potentially indicating unusual financial sources.</p><p>• Deposits or funds held in the account without being used for gambling.</p><p>• Deposits made into gaming accounts followed by swift cash-outs without substantial gameplay.</p><p>• Customer frequently wagers substantial amounts while seemingly accepting substantial losses.</p><p>• Gradual escalation of spending over time to obscure high expenditure.</p><p>• Frequent small bets contributing to elevated annual spending inconsistent with expected patterns.</p><p>• High spending in gambling, such as betting on red and black in roulette, guarantees minimal losses.</p><p>• Significant commercial risk for the operator due to the customer's high spending, which could suggest suspicious activity.</p><p><strong>Terrorist Financing Indicators:</strong><br>Indicators for terrorist financing often mirror money laundering indicators, with some distinctions. For instance, amounts related to terrorist financing are typically smaller than those seen in money laundering activities.</p><p><strong>15.7.4. Financial Sanctions Compliance</strong></p><p><strong>Customer Identity Verification and Sanctions Check:</strong> 1oBet follows a strict policy of verifying the identity of all customers and ensuring they are not subject to sanctions or other legal measures that prevent the Company from offering its services. The identity verification process includes a comprehensive check for sanctions or statutory measures by the staff member responsible. This involves employing screening methods approved by the MLRO (Money Laundering Reporting Officer). These methods encompass direct inquiries with the customer, screening against sanctions and databases, and continuous monitoring through subscriptions to commercial products that provide automatic updates.</p><p><strong>15.7.5. Adverse Media Screening</strong></p><p><strong>Identification of Adverse Media Links:</strong> In addition to examining Sanctions and PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) databases, external providers offer a service to scan individuals for adverse media mentions. 1oBet utilizes this service to determine whether a customer has been connected to financial misconduct, terrorist financing, or other criminal activities in the media. If such a connection is established between the individual and 1oBet's customer base, their ability to use 1oBet services will be subject to careful review by the MLRO and/or senior management before any<br>decision is made.</p><p><strong>15.8. Anti-Bribery and Whistleblowing</strong></p><p><strong>Comprehensive Policies:</strong> As an extension of our commitment to AML/CFT efforts, 1oBet has implemented Anti-Bribery and Whistleblowing Policies and Procedures. These standalone documents are accessible to all employees and are part of their onboarding package. They provide clear guidelines and instructions to ensure a high standard of ethical conduct and to enable the reporting of any concerns related to bribery or unethical behavior within the company.</p><p><strong>15.9. Employee Integrity Checks</strong></p><p><strong>Ensuring Staff Integrity:</strong> 1oBet places great emphasis on maintaining the integrity of its workforce and their adherence to company policies. To ensure this, the Human Resources Department plays a pivotal role in conducting thorough background checks on all new staff members. The following checks are conducted and documented: • Verification and confirmation of references, if required. • Validation of employment history and qualifications. • Request for a recent police conduct certificate. • Review of any regulatory actions taken against the individual</p><p>These measures ensure that the staff at 1oBet maintains a high level of integrity and alignment with the company's policies and procedures.</p><p><strong>16. Fraud Prevention and Consequences</strong></p><p>We are dedicated to combatting fraud, dishonesty, and criminal activities by taking both legal and contractual actions against customers engaged in such activities. In cases where suspicion arises, we reserve the right to withhold payment to customers.

These policies and procedures are:</p><p>•	Developed and maintained by the MLRO under senior management's supervision.</p><p>•	Approved by senior management.</p><p>•	Communicated, understood, and followed by all staff dealing with customers and transactions.</p><p>•	Cover areas like customer identification, record-keeping, and reportable transactions.</p><p>•	Incorporate reporting, record-keeping, customer identification, risk assessment, and risk mitigation requirements.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities of Directors and Senior Officers:</strong> While not involved in daily compliance, directors and senior officers need to understand their statutory duties, the obligations of their staff, and the company's responsibilities.</p><p><strong>15.4.1 The Risk-Based Approach</strong></p><p><strong>A Comprehensive Approach to Risk Management: </strong>A risk-based approach to money laundering and terrorist financing includes:</p><p>•	Assessing the risks of customer relationships and business activities.</p><p>•	Implementing controls to mitigate identified risks.</p><p>•	Ensuring accurate customer identification, beneficial ownership, and business relationship information.</p><p>•	Continuously monitoring business relationships and transactions.</p><p><strong>Meeting Regulatory Standards: </strong>While existing regulatory obligations set a minimum requirement, our risk-based approach focuses resources where they are most needed to manage risks within our acceptable tolerance level. This ensures that we meet regulatory standards while effectively managing potential risks.</p><p><strong>5.4.2 Risk Mitigation Strategies</strong></p><p><strong>Managing Identified Risks:</strong> Risk mitigation involves putting in place measures to control and minimize the potential risks of money laundering and terrorist financing identified in our risk assessment. These measures are designed to ensure that we operate within our acceptable risk tolerance level. When our risk assessment indicates a high risk of money laundering or terrorist financing, we will develop and apply risk mitigation strategies.</p><p><strong>Key Components of Risk Mitigation:</strong> In all situations, risk mitigation involves implementing various controls and measures, including:</p><p>•	Focusing on vulnerable operational aspects like products, services, customers, business relationships, and geographic locations that could be exploited by money launderers and criminals.</p><p>•	Keeping senior management informed about compliance initiatives, identified deficiencies, and corrective actions, and filed suspicious transaction reports.</p><p>•	Ensuring program continuity despite changes in management, employees, or company structure.</p><p>•	Adhering to regulatory record-keeping and reporting requirements, recommendations for anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing compliance, and promptly updating in response to changes.</p><p>•	Identifying reportable transactions and ensuring accurate filing of necessary reports.</p><p>•	Incorporating anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing compliance into job roles and performance evaluations of relevant personnel.</p><p>•	Providing adequate supervision and training for employees handling currency transactions, completing reports, monitoring suspicious transactions, and other program-related activities.</p><p><strong>Tailored Risk Mitigation:</strong> For higher-risk situations, additional risk mitigation strategies are applied, including:</p><p>•	Increasing awareness of high-risk scenarios across all business lines.</p><p>•	Enhancing the frequency of ongoing transaction monitoring and business relationship checks.</p><p>•	Escalating approval for account or relationship establishment, even if not typically required.</p><p>•	Strengthening ongoing control levels and relationship reviews.</p><p>•	Requesting documented information from high-risk customers about the measures they've taken to prevent misuse by money launderers and terrorists.</p><p>•	Verifying customer identity through reliable, independent sources.</p><p>•	Ensuring no transaction occurs with potential customers until proper identification and account opening details are obtained.</p><p>•	Establishing a process to approve high-risk relationships as part of the customer acceptance process, or declining business with those exceeding our risk tolerance.</p><p>•	Establishing a process to exit high-risk relationships that surpass our risk tolerance.</p><p><strong>Understanding Risks:</strong> 1oBet is committed to conducting a thorough risk assessment to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities related to money laundering and terrorist financing. This assessment helps us understand the risks the business might face and take appropriate measures to address them.</p><p><strong>Key Considerations:</strong> The risk assessment process will document and take into account several factors, including:</p><p>•	Products, services, and how they are delivered.</p><p>•	Geographic locations and areas where operations occur.</p><p>•	Characteristics of our customers.</p><p><strong>Adapting Over Time: </strong>The risk assessment isn't a fixed document; it evolves as circumstances change. It may identify high-risk situations that require specific risk mitigation controls and monitoring. For instance, when a customer is categorized as high-risk, we intensify ongoing monitoring, update customer identification information more frequently, and implement other suitable enhanced measures.</p><p><strong>Continuous Monitoring: </strong>At the start of a new customer relationship and on an ongoing basis for existing customers, we conduct initial and periodic risk assessments to ensure our risk understanding remains up-to-date.</p><p><strong>15.5 Client and Business Risk</strong></p><p><span style="color: black;font-size: 12pt;font-family: Segoe UI", sans-serif;"><strong>15.5.1 Products, Services, and Delivery Channels</strong></span><strong>  </strong></p><p><strong>Identifying Elevated Risk: </strong>1oBet identifies certain products, services, or combinations thereof that could present a heightened risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. This includes products and services facilitating the movement and conversion of assets through the financial system, which inherently carry higher risks.</p><p><strong>Specific High-Risk Areas: </strong>Certain financial services have been recognized by financial regulators, governmental bodies, and reputable sources as having the potential for high-risk money laundering or terrorist financing. These include:</p><p>•	Wire transactions</p><p>•	Transactions involving third parties</p><p>•	Business relationships conducted without face-to-face interactions</p><p><strong>Understanding these higher-risk areas allows us to implement targeted risk mitigation strategies and monitoring to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations.</strong></p><p><strong>15.5.2 Geographic Locations and Areas of Operation</strong></p><p><strong>Understanding Geographic Risks: </strong>Certain geographic locations are more prone to money laundering and terrorist financing risks. These areas have been highlighted by reputable sources like the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) and Transparency International.</p><p><strong>High-Risk Countries:</strong> Clients originating from or associated with these countries are deemed high risk:</p><p>•	Countries subject to sanctions, embargoes, or similar measures.</p><p>•	Countries identified by credible sources as supporting terrorist activities or hosting designated terrorist organizations.</p><p>•	Countries are known as tax havens or hubs for significant criminal activities.</p><p>•	Countries flagged by FATF as uncooperative in anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing efforts.</p><p>•	Countries lacking proper money laundering or terrorist financing laws and regulations, or with substantial corruption levels.</p><p><strong>Exclusion of High-Risk Countries: 1oBet refrains from conducting business or offering services to individuals in countries listed under comprehensive international sanctions.</strong></p><p><strong>15.5.3 Customer Relationships</strong></p><p><strong>Comprehensive Understanding:</strong> Our risk assessment calls for a thorough understanding of customers through KYC (Know Your Customer) practices. This entails more than just identification or record keeping; it involves comprehending their activities, transaction patterns, and operational methods.</p><p>Factors Considered: Factors taken into account include:</p><p>•	Duration of the customer relationship.</p><p>•	Customers seeking significant transactions.</p><p>•	Customers with regulatory or enforcement issues.</p><p>•	Customers with numerous online complaints.</p><p>•	Customers with challenging identification verification.</p><p>•	Politically exposed customers.</p><p><strong>Categorizing Customer Risk: </strong>Every customer is assigned a low, medium, or high-risk rating for money laundering and/or terrorist financing. This rating may evolve based on re-assessments. The extent of customer due diligence varies according to the initial risk rating and subsequent changes. High-risk players undergo enhanced due diligence right from the start.</p><p><strong>15.5.4 Regulatory Risk</strong></p><p>Ensuring Legal Compliance: Regulatory risk pertains to failing to meet our obligations under relevant legislation. Examples of regulatory breaches encompass:</p><p>•	Incorrect customer identification.</p><p>•	Insufficient staff training.</p><p>•	Lack of an anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) program.</p><p>•	Failure to report suspicious transactions.</p><p>•	Absence of an MLRO (Money Laundering Reporting Officer).</p><p>•	Incomplete customer record keeping.</p><p><strong>15.5 Compliance Training</strong></p><p><strong>Building Knowledge:</strong> 1oBet maintains a comprehensive training program for relevant employees and individuals representing the company. The objective is to ensure that those who interact with customers, oversee customer transaction activity, or handle funds comprehend reporting, customer identification, and record-keeping requirements.</p><p><strong>New Employee Training: </strong>New employees must complete anti-money laundering and terrorist financing compliance training within their initial three months. For customer-facing personnel, training occurs before engaging with customers.</p><p><strong>Training Approach: </strong>Our custom-designed training program is delivered electronically through a learning management system. The content is reviewed and updated by the MLRO to align with evolving requirements. Training includes a mandatory test to validate comprehension.</p><p><strong>Ongoing Training: </strong>Existing employees receive recurrent training on new and existing AML and regulatory obligations, usually within a year of their previous training. If test results indicate a lack of understanding, specialized one-on-one training is provided.</p><p><strong>Record Keeping:</strong> The MLRO and Human Resources retain a record of assigned and completed training materials for administrative purposes, retained for five years.</p><p><strong>Tailored Training:</strong> Training is tailored to an employee's role, ensuring they understand:</p><p>•	Reporting, customer identification, and record-keeping requirements, along with associated penalties.</p><p>•	Internal policies and procedures for detecting and deterring money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>•	Responsibilities under these policies and procedures.</p><p>•	Vulnerability of 1oBet to criminal abuse and terrorism financing.</p><p>•	Non-disclosure of suspicious transaction reports to prejudicially impact a criminal investigation.</p><p>•	Legal protection for making reports in good faith.</p><p>•	Background on money laundering and typical processes.</p><p>•	Details about terrorist financing processes.</p><p><strong>Staying Current: </strong>The MLRO updates employees about changes in anti-money laundering or anti-terrorist financing legislation, policies, procedures, and pertinent developments in money laundering or terrorist financing schemes.</p><p><strong>Specialized Training: </strong>Certain roles necessitate specialized training, provided either externally or internally, based on compliance, customer service, and operational demands. The training program is continuously reviewed and updated to accommodate changing requirements.</p><p><strong>15.6. Minimum Standards - Know Your Customer (KYC) Policy</strong></p><p><strong>Establishing KYC Standards:</strong> 1oBet adheres to stringent standards for Know-Your-Customer (KYC) practices. These standards mandate thorough due diligence on each potential customer before establishing a business relationship. This involves verifying their identity, as well as that of their representatives and beneficial owners, based on reliable and independent sources in compliance with domestic and European AML/CFT regulations.</p><p><strong>KYC Interpretation: </strong>The KYC principle commences with customer identification using essential identification documents. This initial identification, complemented by other collected information, serves as the basis for applying the Customer Acceptance Policy. Beyond objective criteria, subjective factors that might raise suspicions about a customer require careful attention.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Data and Ongoing Monitoring:</strong> KYC involves not just static data but also dynamic information acquired during the customer relationship. As such, it necessitates continuous follow-up and monitoring.</p><p><strong>15.6.1. Customer Identification and Verification (KYC)</strong></p><p>Essential Customer Identification: Properly identifying customers during the initiation of commercial relationships is pivotal for both anti-money laundering regulations and the KYC policy.</p><p><strong>Key Principles:</strong></p><p>•	Each customer (individual or legal entity) must be identified using original supporting documents.</p><p>•	These documents are centrally recorded.</p><p>•	Identification requires "face-to-face" interaction.</p><p>•	Remote identification is permissible through a dedicated acceptance process, albeit with limitations on transactions and product access.</p><p>•	Registered by IT means, identified individuals must undergo a complete identification process.</p><p>•	Incomplete identification results in customer non-acceptance.</p><p>Politically Exposed Persons (PEP): A distinctive identification process is applied to customers classified as PEPs, regardless of their residence.</p><p><strong>15.6.2. Risk Profile Calculation</strong></p><p>Assessing AML/CFT Due Diligence: To determine the required level of AML/CFT due diligence for a customer, a "Compliance" risk profile is initially calculated upon entering the relationship (Low, Medium, High), then recalculated daily.</p><p><strong>15.6.3. Customer Acceptance Policy</strong></p><p><strong>Customer Identification:</strong> The Client Identification process confirms the existence and identity of the individual engaged in a business relationship with 1oBet, obtaining pertinent identity information. This includes:</p><p>•	Validating the individual's existence via identification documents.</p><p>•	Conducting due diligence on the customer's identity, including cross-referencing names against government watch lists.</p><p>•	Identifying politically exposed persons.</p><p>•	Assessing third-party involvement.</p><p>•	Review publicly available information on the customer (e.g., adverse media, social media).</p><p>•	Evaluating their background and reputation.</p><p>•	Comprehensive record-keeping of acquired data and documents.</p><p><strong>15.6.3.2. Customer Identification Details</strong></p><p><strong>Standard Identification Requirements:</strong> This section outlines the standard identification criteria for individuals engaged in a business relationship with 1oBet. These guidelines are generally sufficient for most scenarios. However, if a customer is deemed to pose a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing, by our risk matrix, additional identity information is necessary, along with heightened verification measures.</p><p><strong>Heightened Verification: </strong>If the standard verification process raises doubts about identity, the number of matches required to establish confidence in the individual's identity will increase. Any concerns encountered must be reported to the <em>MLRO.</em></p><p><strong>Primary Identification Absence:</strong> Customers unable to provide primary ID must provide reasons for this, but they might not be eligible to maintain an account.</p><p><strong>Documentary Evidence Validity:</strong> All submitted documentary evidence should be recent and adhere to specific validity guidelines:</p><p>•	Passports and driver's licenses must be valid and not expired.</p><p>•	Utility bills should be dated within the last 3 months.</p><p>Beneficial Ownership and Additional Information: Customers will be asked if they're acting on behalf of someone else. If so, additional details will be required.</p><p><strong>Acceptable Proof of Identity - Photo:</strong></p><p>•	Valid passport</p><p>•	Valid photo card driving license (full or provisional)</p><p>•	National identity card&nbsp;</p><p>•	Identity card from the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland</p><p>Acceptable Proof of Identity - Non-Photo: Documents issued by government departments, showing the person's name, residential address, or date of birth:</p><p>•	Court appointment instrument (e.g., grant of probate, bankruptcy)</p><p>•	Current council tax demand letter or statement</p><p>•	Recent bank statements or credit/debit card statements from regulated financial sector firms in the UK, EU, or equivalent jurisdiction</p><p>•	Recent utility bill (gas, water, electricity, telephone)</p><p>•	Valid photo card driving license (full or provisional)</p><p>•	Solicitor's letter confirming house purchase or previous address change</p><p><strong>Verification Checks:</strong> When accepting identity evidence from a customer, thorough checks must be conducted on the provided evidence to confirm their identity. These checks and record-keeping will be overseen by the MLRO or under their supervision.</p><p><strong>Photo ID Checks: Standard checks on photo IDs include:</strong></p><p>•	Comparing the customer's likeness with the photo</p><p>•	Verifying that the date of birth matches the apparent age</p><p>•	Validating the ID's authenticity and expiration</p><p>•	Ensuring name consistency with other provided documents</p><p><strong>Secondary ID Checks: For secondary evidence of ID:</strong></p><p>•	Confirming address alignment with photo ID</p><p>•	Ensuring name alignment with photo ID</p><p>Document Retention: Copies of all identification documents will be retained.</p><p>15.6.3.4. Request for Additional Documents</p><p><strong>Additional documents may be requested to validate activities or understand patterns: </strong></p><p>• Proof of Bank Account - A bank statement with the customer's name, IBAN, and bank name (for withdrawals to bank accounts)&nbsp;</p><p>• Proof of Payment Card - Front side of the card or bank statement with card details and customer's name (for suspicious deposit patterns)&nbsp;</p><p>• Bank Statements and Payslips - For customers displaying problematic gambling patterns</p><p><strong>15.7. Internal Control Organization</strong></p><p>Reporting Suspicious Activities: Any member can report suspicious activities to the MLRO (Nominated Officer) if they suspect money laundering or terrorist financing. Suspicion arises when there are reasonable grounds to believe someone is engaged in such activities.</p><p><strong>15.7.1. Reporting Suspicious Transactions</strong></p><p><strong>Knowledge and Suspicion: </strong>Knowledge involves knowing something as true, often inferred from circumstances. Suspicion is subjective and falls short of concrete evidence, implying a foundation. Unusual transactions aren't necessarily suspicious.</p><p><strong>Consideration and Assessment: </strong>Unusual behavior doesn't automatically imply money laundering suspicion. The MLRO assesses circumstances, possibly questioning customers or others. The choice depends on existing knowledge about the customer and transaction.</p><p><strong>Objective Test of Suspicion: </strong>"Reasonable grounds to know or suspect" introduces an objective test of suspicion. It's met when facts or circumstances lead a reasonable person to infer knowledge or suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing.</p><p><strong>Mitigation through Reasonable Steps:</strong> Failing the suspicion test is mitigated if staff can show they took reasonable steps to understand the customer and transaction rationale.</p><p>15.7.2 Reporting Suspicious Activity</p><p><strong>Process of Reporting:</strong> If any staff member suspects a transaction involves money laundering or becomes aware of such activity, they must report it to the MLRO using the 1oBet Suspicious Transaction Report form.</p><p><strong>Reporting Form Completion: </strong>The completed form should be printed, signed, and dated by the reporting staff member before handing it to the MLRO. The MLRO records the receipt date and time.</p><p><strong>MLRO's Decision and Action: </strong>Upon receiving the form, the MLRO decides on necessary actions, such as reporting to Gaming Control Board, Curacao, or conducting further inquiries. The decision and its reasons are recorded in customer files, and the reporting staff member is informed.</p><p></p><p><strong>15.7.3 Identifying Suspicious Activity</strong></p><p><strong>Recognizing Suspicion:</strong> Transactions may raise suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing, regardless of the transaction amount. There is no set monetary limit for reporting suspicious activity (SAR). Suspicious transactions might involve seemingly insignificant factors that collectively indicate potential involvement in money laundering or terrorist financing.</p><p><strong>Indicators of Suspicion:</strong> 1oBet will investigate complex, unusually large transactions, and unusual transaction patterns lacking clear economic or lawful purpose. The context of the transaction matters, varying between customers. Evaluation is based on industry norms, business knowledge, and customer behavior.</p><p><strong>Assessing Suspicion: </strong>Suspicion is tied to behavior, not individuals. Factors like a transaction's alignment with business norms and customer history determine suspicion. Below are some indicators aiding assessment.</p><p><strong>15.7.4 Suspicious Transaction Indicators</strong></p><p><strong>Risk-Linked Factors:</strong> Some products, services, activities, or channels pose higher money laundering risks. Indicators or "red flags" signaling potential risk include:</p><p>•	Unusual frequency of transactions.</p><p>•	Large cash deposits or withdrawals.</p><p>•	Rapid movement of funds.</p><p><strong>Collective Analysis: </strong>One indicator alone might not raise suspicion, but several combined can warrant closer examination before reporting.</p><p>Terrorism Connection: If a transaction is halted due to suspicion of terrorism involvement, a terrorist property report is required. Suspicious transactions linked to attempted terrorism or money laundering must be reported.</p><p><strong>Retrospective Awareness: </strong>Identifying certain indicators might retrospectively raise suspicion about past transactions that seemed innocent initially.</p><p><strong>15.7.4.1 Application and Identification</strong></p><p><strong>Application Discrepancies: </strong></p><p>• Inconsistent information compared to application.&nbsp;</p><p>• Address or customer details differing from initial registration.&nbsp;</p><p>• Inability to provide a government-issued ID.&nbsp;</p><p>• Change of address to high-fraud areas after application.&nbsp;</p><p>• Unverifiable individual details.&nbsp;</p><p>• Use of mail drops or high-risk addresses instead of physical ones.&nbsp;</p><p>• Inconsistency in transaction volume, deposits, and withdrawals.</p><p><strong>15.7.4.2 Account Settlement Large Cross-Border Transfers: </strong></p><p>• Significant wire transfer payments across borders.&nbsp;</p><p>• Settlements from unrelated third parties.&nbsp;</p><p>• Excessive or ongoing large credit refunds.</p><p><strong>15.7.4.3 Transaction and Customer Monitoring Unusual Betting Behavior: </strong></p><p>• Unusually high stakes beyond known means.&nbsp;</p><p>• High spending despite low income and accommodations.&nbsp;</p><p>• Unconventional gambling patterns indicate unlawful income.</p><p><strong>A typical Gambling Patterns: </strong></p><p>• High deposits with minimal gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>• Regular high spending, accepting losses as part of money laundering.&nbsp;</p><p>• Gradual spending increases over time to conceal high expenditure.&nbsp;</p><p>• Frequent small bets leading to abnormal annual spending.&nbsp;</p><p>• Low-risk, high-spend gambling (e.g., red and black in roulette).</p><p><strong>Commercial Risk Alert: </strong>• High spending leads to significant commercial risk for the operator.</p><p><strong>Terrorist Financing Indicators: </strong></p><p>Indicators for terrorism-related financing often resemble money laundering indicators, albeit with some differences. For instance, amounts for terrorist financing tend to be smaller.</p><p><strong>15.7.4.1 Application and Identification</strong></p><p><strong>Discrepancies in Application: </strong></p><p>• Conflicting information compared to the application.&nbsp;</p><p>• Divergence in application details, address, or customer from initial registration.&nbsp;</p><p>• Inability to furnish government-issued identification.&nbsp;</p><p>• Address change to high-fraud regions or problematic jurisdictions soon after application.&nbsp;</p><p>• Lack of reliable third-party or governmental verification for individuals.&nbsp;</p><p>• Address linked to mail drops or high-risk locations instead of physical addresses.&nbsp;</p><p>• Inconsistencies in transaction volume, deposits, and withdrawals.</p><p><strong>15.7.4.2 Account Settlement</strong></p><p><strong>Large Cross-Border Transfers: </strong></p><p>• Significant wire transfers involving different countries.&nbsp;</p><p>• Settlements or partial settlements from unrelated third parties.&nbsp;</p><p>• Excessive or continuous significant credit refunds.</p><p><strong>15.7.4.3 Transaction and Customer Monitoring</strong></p><p><strong>Unusual Betting Behavior:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>• Unusually high stakes surpassing known means.&nbsp;</p><p>• Excessive spending by a customer with limited income or modest accommodations.&nbsp;</p><p>• No fixed amount triggering a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR); depends on the customer's profile and circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>• Patterns of gambling deviating from the customer's typical behavior, potentially indicating unusual financial sources.&nbsp;</p><p>• Deposits or funds held in the account without being used for gambling. • Deposits made into gaming accounts followed by swift cash-outs without substantial gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>• Customer frequently wagers substantial amounts while seemingly accepting substantial losses.&nbsp;</p><p>• Gradual escalation of spending over time to obscure high expenditure.&nbsp;</p><p>• Frequent small bets contributing to elevated annual spending inconsistent with expected patterns.&nbsp;</p><p>• High spending in gambling, such as betting on red and black in roulette, guarantees minimal losses.&nbsp;</p><p>• Significant commercial risk for the operator due to the customer's high spending, which could suggest suspicious activity.</p><p><strong>Terrorist Financing Indicators:</strong> Indicators for terrorist financing often mirror money laundering indicators, with some distinctions. For instance, amounts related to terrorist financing are typically smaller than those seen in money laundering activities.</p><p><strong>15.7.4. Financial Sanctions Compliance</strong></p><p>Customer Identity Verification and Sanctions Check: 1oBet follows a strict policy of verifying the identity of all customers and ensuring they are not subject to sanctions or other legal measures that prevent the Company from offering its services. The identity verification process includes a comprehensive check for sanctions or statutory measures by the staff member responsible. This involves employing screening methods approved by the MLRO (Money Laundering Reporting Officer). These methods encompass direct inquiries with the customer, screening against sanctions and databases, and continuous monitoring through subscriptions to commercial products that provide automatic updates.</p><p><strong>15.7.5. Adverse Media Screening</strong></p><p>Identification of Adverse Media Links: In addition to examining Sanctions and PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) databases, external providers offer a service to scan individuals for adverse media mentions. 1oBet utilizes this service to determine whether a customer has been connected to financial misconduct, terrorist financing, or other criminal activities in the media. If such a connection is established between the individual and 1oBet's customer base, their ability to use 1oBet services will be subject to careful review by the MLRO and/or senior management before any decision is made.</p><p><strong>15.8. Anti-Bribery and Whistleblowing</strong></p><p>Comprehensive Policies: As an extension of our commitment to AML/CFT efforts, 1oBet has implemented Anti-Bribery and Whistleblowing Policies and Procedures. These standalone documents are accessible to all employees and are part of their onboarding package. They provide clear guidelines and instructions to ensure a high standard of ethical conduct and to enable the reporting of any concerns related to bribery or unethical behavior within the company.</p><p><strong>15.9. Employee Integrity Checks</strong></p><p><strong>Ensuring Staff Integrity: </strong>1oBet places great emphasis on maintaining the integrity of its workforce and its adherence to company policies. To ensure this, the Human Resources Department plays a pivotal role in conducting thorough background checks on all new staff members. The following checks are conducted and documented:&nbsp;</p><p>• Verification and confirmation of references, if required.&nbsp;</p><p>• Validation of employment history and qualifications.&nbsp;</p><p>• Request for a recent police conduct certificate.&nbsp;</p><p>• Review any regulatory actions taken against the individual.</p><p><strong>These measures ensure that the staff at 1oBet maintain a high level of integrity and alignment with the company's policies and procedures.</strong></p><p><strong>16. Fraud Prevention and Consequences</strong></p><p>We are dedicated to combatting fraud, dishonesty, and criminal activities by taking both legal and contractual actions against customers engaged in such activities. In cases where suspicion arises, we reserve the right to withhold payment to customers. Any costs, charges, or losses incurred by us due to customer fraud, dishonesty, or criminal actions will be the responsibility of the customer, who will indemnify us accordingly.</p><p><strong>17. Responsible Gaming Commitment</strong></p><p>At 1oBet, we are committed to promoting responsible gambling behaviors, raising awareness about problem gambling, and enhancing prevention, intervention, and treatment efforts.</p><p>Our Responsible Gambling Approach: Our Responsible Gambling Policy outlines our commitment to mitigating the adverse impacts of problem gambling and encouraging responsible gaming practices.

Separate bets are needed for cross-multiple bets.</p><p>•	Odds in Exchange Multiples, except for Starting Price (BSP) bets, are based on Exchange's relevant singles markets.</p><p>•	BSP Exchange Multiples' winnings aren't subject to commission.

Starting Price Regulations</strong></p><p>The following regulations outline the rules for Starting Price <em>('SP') </em>on the Exchange:</p><p>•	SP is accessible on the Exchange and is calculated through the equilibrium of SP bets and other Exchange bets when the market suspends at the event's 'off' moment.</p><p>•	It's important to note that once SP bets are placed, customers cannot retract or cancel them.</p><p>•	SP bets constitute fixed odds wagers. Odds are determined by matching SP backers and layers against other Exchange backers and layers.</p><p>•	The SP calculation encompasses unmatched other Exchange bets to ensure fairness in the process.</p><p>•	Despite the SP calculation being accurate to six decimal places, it may be displayed in a rounded form with two decimal places.</p><p>•	In cases where the site becomes unavailable at the event's start or SP reconciliation becomes problematic, SP determination relies on all available data.</p><p>•	In scenarios where an SP reconciliation is reversed, bets return to their pre-reconciliation status.</p><p>•	If SP reconciliation happens late and a significant event transpires, SP determination is based solely on bets placed before the 'off'.</p><p>•	The SP 'each way' option translates into two distinct bets: an SP win a bet and an SP 'to be placed' bet.</p><p>•	It's important to highlight that unmatched '<em>At In-play: </em>Take SP' bets could be converted to SP bets if unmatched bets are annulled before the event enters the <em>'in-play' phase. </em>Once converted, these bets cannot be revoked.</p><p><strong>Betting at Starting Price (SP) Guidelines</strong></p><p><strong>1.   Opposing Party in SP Bets:</strong></p><p>· When placing an SP bet, you're engaging in a bet against other customers. During the SP reconciliation, it acts as a counterparty to ensure a balanced outcome between SP bets and other Exchange bets.</p><p><strong>2.   Placing an SP Bet:</strong></p><p>· The 'SP' button in the market view offers two ways to request an SP bet:</p><p>·    <strong>  Method 1: </strong>Leave the 'Set SP odds limit' box unticked at the top right of the bet manager.</p><p>· For a back bet, input the stake you want to wager.</p><p>· For a lay bet, input the liability you're willing to risk, representing your potential loss if the selection wins or places.</p><p><strong>·      Method 2:</strong> Choose the 'Set SP odds limit' option.</p><p>· Here, you can request an SP bet with a minimum SP odds requirement for a back bet or a maximum SP odds cap for a lay bet.</p><p>· If SP falls outside the specified range, the bet might not be matched.</p><p><strong>3.   Effect of Non-Runners on SP Bets:</strong></p><p>· If a non-runner remains in the market after an event, matched SP back bets will not be altered in terms of stake or odds.</p><p>· For SP lay bets on win markets, liability is adjusted based on the reduction factor of non-runners and the specific runner's reduction factor.</p><p>· SP lays bets on place markets following a similar principle, adjusting liabilities and potential winnings based on reduction factors.</p><p>· SP lay bets will not be canceled due to non-runners.</p><p><strong>4.   Specifics for Greyhound Racing Markets:</strong></p><p>· All SP bets remain valid unless the selected trap is vacant or a reserve runner is subsequently added to that trap after bet placement.</p><p>· Unmatched 'Convert to SP' bets will be canceled if a reserve runner is introduced or a vacant trap is filled.</p><p><strong>11. 'Keep' Bet Option</strong></p><p>·      Persistent Unmatched Bets: For markets transitioning in-play at the 'off,' customers have the option to retain unmatched Exchange bets, preventing their cancellation during the <em>in-play transition</em>. This is achieved by selecting <em>'At In-Play: Keep' </em>in the bet manager. These unmatched bets will persist while others are canceled at the event start.</p><p>·      Impact of Non-Runners: In horseracing markets, non-runners with a reduction factor of 2.5% or more (for win markets) or 4.0% or more (for place markets) prompt cancellation of unmatched lay offers on other runners. However, lay bets with the 'At In-Play: Keep' option selected will remain. Lay odds in place markets and win markets (with non-runners having at least a 2.5% reduction) are adjusted accordingly.</p><p>·      Late Withdrawals: If a late withdrawal is deemed a material runner (20% reduction factor or higher), unmatched lay 'keep' bets may be canceled before turning the market<em> in-play.</em> Otherwise, 'keep' bets remain unaffected.</p><p>·      Cancellation Exceptions: Generally, 'keep' bets will not be canceled unless they remain unmatched when the market is finally closed at the event's end. For instance, even if other unmatched bets are canceled due to a Material Event in a soccer match, 'keep' bets will not be canceled.</p><p><strong>12. Miscellaneous Points</strong></p><p>·      Time Zones: Time references in the Exchange Rules correspond to the event's local time zone.</p><p>·      Accuracy and Liability: Information is provided in good faith, but the platform is not liable for errors or omissions in posted prices, runners, times, scores, results, or statistics.</p><p>·      Error Corrections: Obvious errors will be corrected, and market integrity maintained.</p><p>·      Suspension and Voiding: The platform can suspend or void markets and bets in specific scenarios to ensure fairness.</p><p>·      Rule Amendments: The platform reserves the right to amend Exchange Rules at any time.</p><p>·      Unmatched Bet Protection: Unmatched bets may be canceled to protect customers.</p><p>·      Settlement Rounding: Settlement amounts, including winnings/losses and commission charges, will be rounded to the nearest two decimal places.</p><p>·      Language Versions: The Exchange Rules exist in multiple languages for reference, but in case of differences, the English version prevails.</p><p><strong> Part C - Specific Sports Rules</strong></p><p><strong>1.

It will be turned in-play at the Super Over start. The market won't be actively managed, and customers are responsible for their positions.
